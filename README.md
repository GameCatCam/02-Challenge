# Module 1 - Webpage Refactoring Challenge

## Description 
Given a webpage of which needed to be optimized for accessibility, I used semantic HTML elements, alt descriptions of images, comments, and id tags to clean, condense, and make the code easier to read.

## Usage

This project showed the many ways in which a website may be optimized for accessibility standards. As well as how to clean up and condense code to make it a bit more readable.
